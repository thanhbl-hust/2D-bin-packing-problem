## Reason 

Subject: `Planning Optimization - HUST - 2022.2`

## How can i do this project

We try to solve problem with 4 ways below:
- `Bruteforce Algorithm`: Try all solution, just for very small input.

- `Greedy Algorithms`: 2 greedy algorithm used in this project are 
  * **Guillotine Algorithm**
  * **Maximal Rectangle Algorithm**
- `Mixed Interger Programming`: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) is an optimization method that uses both integer and continuous variables to solve complex problems, widely applied in logistics, manufacturing, and resource management.
- `Constraint Programming`: Constraint Programming (CP) is an optimization technique focusing on defining and solving problems with constraints, often used in scheduling, planning, and combinatorial optimization.

## Result of project!
